Earth Surface Temperature Forecasting Project
Overview
As the global climate undergoes rapid changes, understanding and forecasting Earth's surface temperature has become paramount. The Earth's surface temperature plays a crucial role in various aspects of life on our planet, including agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.

Accurate temperature forecasts are essential for planning and mitigating the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, and shifts in agricultural productivity. Moreover, understanding historical temperature trends helps in analyzing the effectiveness of current climate policies and guiding future actions.

In this project, we aim to forecast Earth's surface temperature using historical temperature data spanning two centuries. By employing state-of-the-art forecasting models, we seek to provide valuable insights into future temperature trends and contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat climate change.
